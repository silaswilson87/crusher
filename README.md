# Autonomous Pump1

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to develope an automated pneumatic can crusher which employs a piston to efficnently and uniformly compact alluminum cans into as dense of a compaction as possible using air power. 

**Note**: To see debug output, create empty file with name "debug" in the root of the feather.
