# Autonomous Pump1

## Overview
Example of an autonomous sensor component.

The primary purpose of this project is to help define and debug a Spring Boot Application that monitors remote sensor components.

It uses three water level measurement sensors for added datapoints to help validate that the hardware is functioning as intended.

**Note**: To see debug output, create empty file with name "debug" in the root of the feather.

## Current state of project
The project is mostly complete. There aren't any current bugs to fix or capabilities that need to be added.

The unit has been running for two+ months without issue with roughly 100+ pumping events.

The original 6v pump was significantly underpowered (needs to pump water up 6') and was replaced with a 12v pump that works flawlessly.
